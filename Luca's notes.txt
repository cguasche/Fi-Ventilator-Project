1: exit of the piston
    if the pressure reading > Pinsp 
        solenoid valve 1 open
        once lung pressure reaches Pinsp, the sensor will read Pinsp
            this causes the solenoid valve 1 to close
            motor rotation is measured to find the displacement of the piston (delta_h)
                gives us tidal volume (delta_h * AP)
                Downward force of piston is equal to Pinsp * AP
                Tells us how much torque is needed in the motor

T_STALL

2: O2 Solenoid Valve

Refilling piston: flow from O2 tank and atmosphere occur simultaneously
Ptank = Pinsp at beginning of refill
    all pressures are above atmospheric
    Flow rate from O2 tank solenoid valve is Q_SOL_O2 = 12015.4145 cm^3/sec (determiend by pressures)
    volume needed to fill up is delta_h * AP = TV
        h_O2 = delta_h/.79 * (FiO2 - .21) <height the piston moves based on FiO2 input>
        volume from O2 tank is V_O2 = h_O2 * AP
            T_SOL_O2 = V_O2 / Q_SOL_O2
            KEY: Relying on the pressure from the solenoid valve to move the piston back up a certain fraction based on FiO2
        
3: Atmospheric Valve
h_air = delta_h - h_O2  
    needs to reach max position again before Texp
        V_piston after oxygen is introduced is equal to h_air / (Texp - T_SOL_O2)
            fast enough motion will reduce interior pressure to below atmospheric pressure, allowing tank to fill up with air
            volume from atmosphere is V_AIR = TV - V_O2

# Definitive equations/process for O2 and Atmospheric Air into Piston



# Control for Solenoid Valve
# TODO: When to open solenoid valve (T_STALL), duration of time soleniod valve stays open (T_SOL_O2)

# Control for exit of oxygen in piston chamber to paitent
# Refer to spsuedocode in #1: exit of the piston
# 



a. Piston is full of air, no compression so no pressure (below Pinsp) applied on the sensor at the piston exit
b. Motor applies torque, which applies force to piston, increasing pressure in the piston
c. Once the pressure sensor below the piston reads larger than the Pinsp input, the solenoid valve is triggered and opened
d. As air leaves piston, the pressure at the sensor drops drastically, but increases as lungs fill with air 
e. As lungs fill up with air, pressure sensor reads and checks value until greater than or equal to Pinsp again (bc no pressure difference) and triggers the close for sol. valve
f. When solenoid valve closes, motor stops applying torque.
g. Wait perido
f. Repeat steps c-e but have intermediate wait period to hold cycle 
g. T_STALL
