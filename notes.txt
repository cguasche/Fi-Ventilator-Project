1: exit of the piston
    if the pressure reading > Pinsp 
        solenoid valve 1 open
        once lung pressure reaches Pinsp, the sensor will read Pinsp
            this causes the solenoid valve 1 to close
            motor rotation is measured to find the displacement of the piston
                gives us tidal volume (delta_h * AP)
                Downward force of piston is equal to Pinsp * AP
                Tells us how much torque is needed in the motor

Refilling piston: flow from O2 tank and atmosphere occur simultaneously
Ptank = Pinsp at beginning of refill
    all pressures are above atmospheric
    volume needed to fill up is delta_h * AP = TV
        volume from O2 tank is delta_h * AP * FiO2 = TV * FiO2
        volume from atmosphere is TV * (1-FiO2)
